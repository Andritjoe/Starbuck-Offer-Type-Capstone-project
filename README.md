## Project Motivation
This project is part of the Udacity Capstone Challenge and the given data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app

Users of the Starbucks rewards mobile app receive an offer once every few days.  An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). However, offers are not sent out to every user and even those that receive one might not all get the same. One of the Starbuck's goal is to send out the right offers to increase the response of users in mobile apps. 

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to optimize Starbucks' promotion strategy, which mean the aim is to give the effective offer that will make customer spend more in starbucks based on the past purchasing behaviour and demographics data of starbuck customers
